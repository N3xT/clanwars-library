# Clans Library

### Introduction

Hello, I made this library a while ago, and to be honest, it's quite useful when it comes to dealing with tournaments and clan-wars servers. Hence, I decided to make it public to everyone.

P.S: It's based on OOP **(Object-oriented programming)**, so, at least you should have a little amount of experience before using it. Also, please if you notice any bugs or misuse of codes please let me know! (Discord: N3xT#0001)

### Classes

You will find a folder called **Classes**, all classes are included in there.

### Example of Use

I made a little file called **main_server.lua**. You should find a few examples in there. And the rest is on you!
