Hello, I made this library a while ago, and to be honest, it's quite useful when it comes to dealing with tournaments and clan-wars servers. Hence, I decided to make it public to everyone.

P.S: It's based on OOP, at least you should have a little amount of experience before using it. Also, please if you notice any bugs or misuse of codes please let me know!
